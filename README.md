Ventifact
=========

Ventifact is a video game programmed in C and uses the SDL libraries. It should be fairly portable although
the game is designed around screen dimensions of 800x480. The main thing to watch out for would be memory alignment
in the memory management system although you can turn that off by not defining MEM_TRACK.

The source code is split into two catagories. Ventifact part for the game and Engine part for the more reusable code.
I mainly used codeblocks to organise the project.

This git repository has been set up to see if it is more convenient for me to use as a backup system and to figure
out how git works!
